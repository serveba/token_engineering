# Token Engineering Notebooks

Jupyter Notebooks for TE module 3

1. Explanation, formulas and calculation examples of a Constant Sum Automated Market Maker (AMM)
2. Explanation, formulas and calculation examples of a Constant Product Automated Market Maker (AMM). 

The point 2 is similar to Uniswap v2. Check also this [link](https://ethereum.org/ca/developers/tutorials/uniswap-v2-annotated-code/) for more details 

## Running the code

For running the code you need Python 3, VSCODE and the [Jupyter Notebook VSCode extension](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/datascience/jupyter-notebooks). After installing, you need to install the dependencies through pip:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Once you have installed the dependencies, you can test the code examples inside VSCODE. 

You can also run the Jupyter Notebooks included with online tools such as [this one](https://jupyter.org/try-jupyter/lab/) among others.
